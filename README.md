## What is this ?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that is aimed at creating landing pages for PIPS projects.

## How to use it ?

You can spin up a new project by creating a repo out of this template.

You would then need to update the static app' data const in the `STATIC_APP_DATA.ts` file. This is the chosen solution while dynamic app data storage is not implemented.

To run the dev server: `npm run dev`.

## How to deploy it ?

We recommend using Vercel for deployments.
